Here's the code for Piano Tiles Auto Clicker

The program takes consecutive screenshots, converts them to grayscale and crops each of them to a fixed region of interest.
If any of the tiles in the region of interest contain a value less than 70 (which can be identified as black), the mouse moves over to the
coordinates and clicks the tile.
